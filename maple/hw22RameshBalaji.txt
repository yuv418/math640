# It makes sense that the tidal strength is proportional
# to m/d^3 by the formula for tidal acceleration.
#
# Since the observed size of the moon is the same as the observed size of the
# sun, but the moon is much closer to earth, the radius of the sun is much much
# larger than the radius of the moon. The distance is at least proportional to r
# (to be honest, this is questionable).
#
# Then we have that T_m >> T_s -> m_m/d_m^3 >> m_s/d_s^3 -> m_m/r_m^3 >>
# m_s/r_s^3 and multiplying by the constant for volume we know the density of
# the moon is much greater.
